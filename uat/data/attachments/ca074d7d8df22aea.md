            - paragraph [ref=e284]: Secure Sockets Layer, or SSL, is an encryption technology that provides secure communications over the Internet. It does this by verifying that the server to which you are connected is actually the one it claims to be. It also encrypts all transactions between the parties communicating. Encryption is the scrambling of information as it is transmitted over the Internet to protect your confidentiality. Personal information passing between your computer and/or mobile device and many of our services is encrypted. This means that while your information is in transit it is scrambled so that only we can reassemble it in its original text format. The support page form where you input your information has HTTPS automatically enabled.
            - paragraph [ref=e285]: Unfortunately, transmission of information through the Internet cannot be completely secure. Although we do our best to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee the security of your personal information transmitted to us through the Site. Any transmission of personal information is at your own risk. We are not responsible for circumvention of any privacy settings or security measures contained on the Site.

We will post all privacy changes and, if we have your contact information to do so, we will notify you of any material change in our privacy practices.
