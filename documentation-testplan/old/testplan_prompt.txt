I have .md files in my workspace for test plans of each user role in my eNcounterCloud PACS application: Physician (physician-testplan1.md and physician-testplan2.md), Administrator (admin-testplan1.md and admin-testplan2.md), Nurse (nurse-testplan1.md and nurse-testplan2.md), Technician (technician-testplan1.md and technician-testplan2.md), Technology (technology-testplan1.md and technology-testplan2.md), Guest (guest-testplan1.md and guest-testplan2.md), and Institution Manager (institution_manager-testplan1.md and institution_manager-testplan2.md), plus a testplan-summary.md for overview. Each file lists test scenarios grouped by functionalities with priorities (CRITICAL, HIGH, MEDIUM), detailed steps, and expected results—e.g., for Physician, Part 1 covers Authentication, Clinical Dashboard, DICOM Viewer basics; Part 2 covers advanced Viewer features, Study Search, Account, Admin.

Generate a single, high-level hierarchical test plan as a markdown (.md) file outline for documentation purposes. Start with a "## Summary Table" using a markdown table showing total scenario counts per section/role (e.g., | Section | Scenario Count |). Then, include a top-level "## Shared/Common Tests" section for identical authentication and access control requirements across roles (e.g., combine all login valid/invalid credentials, EULA acceptance, session timeout, and permissions verification into concise entries here—test them only once, not per role; generalize descriptions to apply system-wide). Then, organize by Role (e.g., Physician, Administrator, Nurse, Technician, Technology, Guest, Institution Manager), sub-group by Functionality (e.g., Authentication and Security—omit here since moved to Shared; Clinical Dashboard; DICOM Viewer), and under each, list unique high-level Test Scenarios as brief descriptions (no detailed steps or expected results). Do not deduplicate beyond authentication/access control (e.g., keep DICOM Viewer scenarios role-specific even if similar). Use tables within sections for listing scenarios to save space and improve readability (columns: Scenario Name, Brief Description, Priority). Include priority levels from the files (per-scenario if varying within functionality). Keep it clear, concise, and focused on role-based features for creating hierarchical test suites in Azure (e.g., top-level folders for Shared and Roles, sub-folders for Functionalities). Total scenarios should align roughly with 491 but adjusted lower for authentication deduplication.
